# Dialog Skill Analysis for Watson Assistant

## Introduction
Dialog Skill Analysis is a Python framework along with an easy-to-use Python notebook to help you quickly and effectively build AI assistants using Watson Assistant 

Whether you are new to the process and are building your first AI assistant or you’re a veteran and have an assistant working well in production, this framework is intended to help everyone with questions like...
- How do I know my assistant is doing a good job?
- How do I test and measure my assistant’s performance?
- Why is the assistant responding incorrectly to this question?
- How do I improve my assistant’s ability to understand questions?

## Usage
If you clone the notebook from this repository locally, please use the steps below. For usage in Watson studio, please refer to the 
session below on [Hosted Python Notebook](#hosted-python-notebook)


1. Assumes familiarity using a Python Jupyter notebook
2. Assumes a Python 3.6 or greater environment (We recommend using Anaconda to setup a python environment)
3. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start jupyter server with `jupyter notebook`
5. Run `skill_analysis.ipynb` to start session
