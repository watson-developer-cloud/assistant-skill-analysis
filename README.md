# Dialog Skill Analysis for Watson Assistant

## Introduction
Dialog Skill Analysis is a new Python framework along with an easy-to-use Python notebook to help you quickly and effectively build AI assistants using Watson Assistant 

Whether you are new to the process and are building your first AI assistant or you’re a veteran and have an assistant working well in production, this new framework is intended to help everyone with questions like...
- How do I know my assistant is doing a good job?
- How do I test and measure my assistant’s performance?
- Why is the assistant responding incorrectly to this question?
- How do I improve my assistant’s ability to understand questions?

We assume familiarity with the Watson Assistant product as well as concepts involved in dialog skill design like intent, entities, utterances etc.
